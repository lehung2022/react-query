Step One
Remember to run this first hand
Run the data.json file by using this command 
npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json 
This step is required, if you want to see the datas that I created for testing purposes
Step Two
type in npm run dev, to run the site
Extra steps
Check very carefully at the package.json file, the dependencies part
That's it. Hope you enjoy this react query that I made. 
I will create a blog post of myself.
